Korty 1.0 Alpha
===============================================================================

What is it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	It's called Korty, for those who didn't get it, KOhana + smaRTY. I think
Kohana v3 could help us with a little bit things more, integrating a powerful
template engine, like Smarty 3.

	Now, imagine it with some beatiful conventions and... KAZAM! This is it!
	
	Inspired by the facilities of Ruby on Rails.
	
	
How it work?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	It's a Kohana Module, with a smarty version inside. It have some small
functions to help writing templates, manage URL's, forms and generating
basic code.
	
	
Basic usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application directory structure
	Be happy! You won't need to create directories to use it, unless you wish
to use custom Smarty plugins. In this case, you must create a folder called
plugins in the root of your application folder.

	All Smarty configuration files (.conf) can be created in the application
config directory.

	Smarty compiled files are located in application cache directory.
	
	Finally, all the templates must be placed in application views directory.
	
Plugins
	Blocks:
	form_tag: create a html form tag. You can use all html params as function
params. if you don't set action param,

	Functions:
	url: to params defines all links to your application using kohana
url::site() function.
